    <h2>White Hat</h2>
    <p>After explaining the goal of my website, my partner and I reviewed the main data for my diabetic-friendly recipes website. I shared how my main audience would be people who need to manage their blood sugar, and its purpose is to create recipes that are safe to eat. Then we looked over the research I had done for my website. Some data I’ve collected so far is information on how to create these friendly recipes and important tips and tricks on how to cook better in the kitchen for the blog section of the website. Then we went over the layout of the website with her. She liked my idea, and after brainstorming ideas, she said my design of the website should be simple to read and access when delivering this information to the audience. She explained that it makes it easier for people to digest data and even recommended using pictures. She also explained that I should have a page explaining what diabetes is, too, for not everyone is familiar with it.</p>

    <h2>Red Hat</h2>
    <p>We started to come up with ideas and designs that would make my website make my audience feel more welcome and secure. Finding diabetic-friendly recipe websites isn't common. Therefore, the design and words need to appear supportive so that my audience would feel my website is trustworthy and non-judgmental. I suggested making my website have a colorful palette while keeping the simplicity to make my designs appear more friendly. My partner liked this idea and also suggested making my work friendlier by using positive vocabulary. This way, my audience would receive facts and information easily while becoming more encouraged and engaged with my website.</p>

    <h2>Black Hat</h2>
    <p>After going over the designs of my website and my work in progress, my partner pointed out that deadlines will be coming up. She explains that even though my designs are good, however, will I realistically be able to create everything on time? Therefore, we started going over what to keep and take out of my design and how to make my workload shorter. She said not to only concentrate on adding so many tips and tricks on the blog, so that I can focus on completely designing the rest of the website. Or how she also mentioned starting to focus on creating my recipes and main page in the beginning, before I go into the rest of the details. This way, I’ve completed the crucial stuff first and won’t have to rush anything, leading me to have time to make my website look more professional and organized.</p>

    <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
    <p>II received many logical positive comments from my partner that she liked. Such as providing a comments section for all my recipes. This is a benefit, she said, as it helps me learn and understand how happy my users are while allowing me to notice what I should improve on my recipes. Leading me to create more recipes in the future that my audience will enjoy. She also mentioned that I should add a star rating to my reviews to know how happy my audience is. Another idea she liked was allowing my users to email me questions if they have any concerns. This can lead to more positive reviews and better results for my audience when communication is accessible.</p>

    <h2>Green Hat</h2>
    <p>We had a long discussion with this hat as we tried to come up with a creative way to improve or add to my website. I plan on having categories for my recipes, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desserts. Therefore, we came up with the idea of creating the categories color-coded while using colors that keep the design looking gentle or warm. We also thought about making color categories for different cultural cuisines after I explained to her wanting to begin incorporating American, Chinese, and Mexican food into my website. We also came up with the idea of having little icons on each recipe's tabs and introduction to let the user know about the dietary details, like which meal has “high fiber” or is "spicy." This can help improve the visuals of my design so my audience will be guided to eat healthier easily, and be able to look for what they want to eat.</p>

    <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
    <p>Finally, my partner and I reflected on our process and ideas. We discussed how to make my design more structured and organized while keeping my audience feeling engaged and secure when using my website. I’ve got some new ideas from our conversation and plan on working on improving and discovering for my website. We both realized how our conversation helps us offer a new perspective on what we should be considering, especially when thinking from the user's perspective. Of course, more research needs to be done to enhance my website and its design. I also plan on making my website and getting it tested by letting my family, friends, and classmates try it out as users to see what I can improve on more. Overall, my partner and I came up with many creative ways to consider my design and website’s functionality for my users.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>After going through the Six Thinking Hats with my partner and having the conversation with her, I was able to collect new possibilities of ideas to help enhance my diabetic-friendly recipe website while becoming more user-friendly and appealing. I plan on creating a page to explain the basic knowledge of diabetes and making my information simpler to digest while structuring my design.  I also gain ideas on how to make my design friendly to use for my audience, such as using the right color palette and positive vocabulary to enhance my users' experiences. Thanks to my partner, I also realized that I need to plan what important goals I need to accomplish first before going into great detail on the design of my website, due to deadlines, making my plan more realistic. I learned how to continue and improve on my review features on my website and make emailing accessible to my users. We also develop ideas to color-code the categories and diverse recipes or add icons to recipe tabs to make it easier for my audience to discover new recipes. Overall, I had developed new ideas to improve my website and started making plans from what I learned for my design and functions on my site. This way, my users will not only be able to easily receive recipes and information on my website, but also develop a positive and secure experience, making my users become long-term members.</p>
