    <h2>Classmate's Discussion </h2>

 <section class="classmate">
    <p>I brainstormed domain names with my classmate during this week, and we came up with different ideas for possible names to use for my website. We only talked about my website because they already did theirs with someone else, so we have a penalty of time for discussion. First, we went over my goal for my final project. I explained how I wanted to create a website that is focused on making recipes that are diabetic-friendly while having a blog on helpful information or tips, such as how to manage your blood sugar or kitchen hacks. Then, we went over the Comprehensive Domain Extensions List. Therefore, we started deciding whether I should put .com or .recipes for my website. Because I was going to include recipes and a blog on my website, we agreed to do .com instead. </p>

     <p>Next, we went over the Domain Naming Slides to help come up with names for my website. For the first name, we came up with DiaDelish.com (diadelish.com). This name is an affixed word that is a combination of "diabetic" and "delicious" put together. We both liked this name, for it was short and catchy to say out loud. The next name was SmartSugarKitchen.com (smartsugarkitchen.com). This phrase name was made out of real words put together with clear meanings. We discussed how "smart" means to find effective resolutions to a problem, "sugar" represented diabetes and maintaining blood sugar, and "kitchen" indicated how the website focuses on recipes and food. The name wasn’t too long because we originally came up with ideas like “SugarSmartsBeingInTheKitchen.com” or “SugarSmartsInTheKitchen.” However, all of those names are too complicated for my website. Finally, the last name we picked was LowGluBites.com (lowglubites.com). “Low” and “glu” added together represent the word “low glucose,” making this part of the name an affixed word. Then “bite” is added at the end of the name to represent eating and taking a bite of food, representing how recipes and meals will be on my website. After double-checking the names on the domain website for availability with my classmate, we agreed to use these three names in the end, as we both liked these names. However, the best name I liked was LowGluBites.com because it was the clearest explanation out of all the other names of what my website will be about. The name wasn't too long that it was hard to remember. The name wasn't too short either for there is more context in this name. I really liked how the name was to the point while remaining pretty creative for my website.</p>
