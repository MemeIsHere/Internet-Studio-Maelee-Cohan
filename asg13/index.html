        <p class="intro">
            An ideal job type for me would be UX design. I’m really interested and majored in learning how to create designs that would help become solutions or benefit other people. I’ve obtained many skills over the years, such as graphic design, photography, videography, audio design, photo editing, video editing, and currently learning a lot of coding. I want to use my abilities and knowledge to help people get the designs they need. I enjoy learning from people to help me come up with smarter ideas. Therefore, I hope to find a job that will help me enhance my creativity while learning more about how the real-world industries function in my career focus. I hope to gain more experience and improve my work, design, and social skills. I enjoy connecting with people and creating designs that others can like too that will be useful.

                I think this opportunity will really be great for my career because I can create designs with people and teams who are destined to help and understand users with their problems, like me. I get deep into UX research to understand the user's problem by doing activities like surveys or interviews, for example. That I get to work on UX and UI design, like creating wireframes, making prototypes in Figma, or making UI mockups like final visuals screens. I’ll also be organizing content, which is information architecture where users can find things quickly, and italy like buttons or navigation. I will also work with a team of developers, product owners, and other diners. Overall, I’m excited that I can learn, create, and grow my skills with others. I will also be creating and finding how to make solutions with my design as well.
