	<h1>Mamamoo Bio</h1>
	<p>	<p>Mamamoo is a South Korean girl band that was created by RBW in 2014 and has been active to this day. There are a total of four girls in the group: Wheein, Moonbyul, Hwasa, and Solar. Mamamoo is known for their strong vocals, expressive writing style in their music, and harmonies as they become a recognizable girl group in the K-pop industry. Since debuting in 2014, the girls have been eliminating stereotypes about gender and fighting against controversial standards in beauty. The girls are presenting themselves in a way that many general K-pop idols will not, challenging criticism and accepted social norms.

	<h2>Why Mamamoo is My Favorite</h2>
	<p>Mamamoo is my favorite band because of how genuine the girl group is. The group is known for supporting individuality and creativity in themselves while changing South Korea's ideology about self-worth, beauty standards, and ideologies of how women should behave or be viewed in society. It was very refreshing to see a girl band that wasn’t swayed by criticisms and the music industry, as the girls remain strong in their identities and appearance. Another reason I enjoy the band so much is their music and performance. I really like Mamamoo music because it’s very catchy and sometimes emotional so I enjoy their songs very much. I also especially like when they performance on stage for their vocals and visual are more enhanced and impressive when the girls perform live.
