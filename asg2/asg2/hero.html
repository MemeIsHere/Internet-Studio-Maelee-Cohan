<h1>Spider-Man: A Teenage Hero</h1>
<p> <p> I had chosen Spider-Man as my hero because growing up I was inspired and enjoyed watching him overcome challenges while remaining as a good character. Spider-Man felt very human and continued to do the right thing despite all the obstacles in his way. Spider-Man was also very relatable to me, for he was a kid who was trying to figure everything out, even his identity in and outside of the mask.</p>
