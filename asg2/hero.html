<h2>Spider-Man: A Teenage Superhero</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> <p> 
To begin, Spider-Man, whose secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker, is a teenager raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City, Queens, after the death of his parents. The teenager was bitten by a radioactive spider that gave him powers, and after the death of his Uncle Ben, he became Spider-Man, a superhero in New York City. Spider-Man’s first appearance was in August 1962 in an Amazing Fantasy comic that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Despite Spider-Man’s age, he isn’t a sidekick like many young superheroes are, nor does he have a mentor, for he is known to be his own hero.
 </p>
 <p>The first reason I chose Spider-Man as my favorite hero was that, growing up, I would watch the Spider-Man series on television and read the comics. Spider-Man was always everywhere in the media and was really popular with the kids, so I was able to get my hands on a lot of media and stories based on the superhero. There were so many stories, art, films, and books about him that I had picked up growing up. The comics, films, and franchise never stopped producing Spider-Man, either, so I was always able to be entertained and engrossed by the superhero.
</p>

 <p>The second reason was how relatable Spider-Man was growing up. I was really inspired by the hero because he was presented as a pretty relatable teenager; therefore, having a character close to my age really made me enjoy their stories more. Outside the mask, Spider-Man is known to be a teenager who faces high school challenges, awkward decisions, and difficulties maintaining relationships around him. His personality and character development make him very relatable and likable. So, I really enjoy adventures because I understand his perspective on how he views the world and sometimes emphasize the experiences he went through.
