    <h2>My Design Statement </h2>

    <p>I chose the city of Nanjing, located in China, because I have family and friends who I am close to living there. Growing up, I had a strong connection with my Chinese relatives and friends; therefore, I always loved Chinese history, culture, films, arts, and food, especially if it’s from Nanjing. I would hear stories from my family and friends living their lives in Nanjing, and I even got to experience it myself when I traveled there for vacation years ago during the summer. The place was lively and constantly busy, a city that holds on to its old traditions while embracing new modern normalities. Therefore, in my design, I chose my visual and interior design to create my website to look traditional while being organized and friendly to my audience, representing Nanjing as a city with modern culture and ancient history.</p>

    <p>To begin, the typeface selection I used was Montserrat and ABeeZee because I wanted my website text to be clear and easy to read while being at an appropriate size. One of the concerns I had when making my website was whether my text was legible; therefore, I selected these fonts because they don’t strain the eyes and place the text sizes large enough so that it’s effortlessly readable. For my color palette, I chose to use various colors of gold and red to create my website to represent the Chinese national flag, while using white to create contrasts and highlights in my design. I also used these colors to help make my websites look more traditional for China, especially Nanjing, which takes deep pride in its historical and cultural roots. For my buttons' style, I wanted them to be rounder than the call-to-action buttons to help better distinguish them from the CTA buttons while making their edges seem more friendly and inviting by creating them to be more circular. I also wanted to use my color palette on my buttons to help my users see the difference between each button, as color can help guide my audience. Next, I wanted my button placement to be noticeable and consistent throughout my pages. Therefore, thanks to my color palette, I located them at the bottom of the pages, so they won’t interfere with my paragraphs or images while remaining available to my users. When I was choosing images for my website, I wanted them to reflect the significance of Nanjing while staying in context with what is being presented on the page. Because most people are visual learners, I wanted my audience to gain insight into what Nanjing would look like and imagine the possibilities that could be, enhancing their curiosity. </p>
