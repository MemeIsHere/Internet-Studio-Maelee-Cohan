  <h1>My Favorite Movies ✨🎀🎬💖🌸</h1>

  <section class="summary">
    <p>These are my top twelve favorite movies that I have watched and enjoyed to this day! Some of them is because I just enjoy watching the film and how it made me feel. Some of them are favorites for I liked the story plot, characters, or the message they convey. Some of these films were relatable and memorable to me growing up. Either way, these are my favorite films of all time to watch, and I want to share what they are about and why I like them so much!</p>

      <img src="images/Detective-Conan-Movie-23.jpg" alt="Movie 1" />
      <h2>Case Closed: The Fist of Blue Sapphire</h2>
      <p>This film is about a thief named Kaito KID who is framed for a murder he didn’t commit, and a detective named Conan who is trying to help him solve this mystery to catch the murderers. Therefore, the two rivals must work together to prevent any more murders from happening before it’s too late. I really liked this anime movie because I’m a big fan of the character Kaito KID, who is popular in the Case Closed franchise. However, Kaito KID isn’t in every Case Closed movie, so when they had him in this movie, I was really excited.</p>

      <h2>Zootopia</h2>
      <p>This movie is about a rabbit police officer named Judy and a fox con artist named Nick who must work together to solve a mystery. Judy is trying to prove to everyone around her that she can become an officer, and Nick is being blackmailed by Judy to help her find the criminals. This movie was funny and a lot of fun to watch, especially when I saw it in theaters with my Mom when it came out.</p>

      <img src="images/Spider-Man.jpeg" alt="Movie 3" />
      <h2>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h2>
      <p>Miles is a teenager at a coming of age when he accidentally got superpowers, and after his Spider-Man passed from his world, he must be the next hero. However, things get complicated as other Spider-Men from other verses start coming into his world, the villain is still causing trouble, and he doesn’t know who he is anymore. I really like this movie because it got me really into Spider-Man and Marvel characters. </p>

      <img src="images/While You Were Sleeping.jpg" alt="Movie 4" />
      <h2>While You Were Sleeping</h2>
      <p>This movie contains one of my Mom’s favorite actresses, Sandra Bullock, who plays Lucy, a Chicago Transit Authority token collector who saved her crush from an upcoming train. The man is in a coma, and somehow she accidentally pretends to be his fiancée,  who then slowly starts to fall in love with her crush’s brother instead. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it felt so magical and cozy as the setting was taking place during Christmas time too.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/The Sound of Music.jpeg" alt="Movie 5" />
      <h2>The Sound of Music</h2>
      <p> This movie is about a nun named Maria who is sent to take care of a household during World War Two and is trying to do her best at becoming the new nanny. It is a musical that is filled with family bonding, romance, and the reality of war during that time. I watched this movie during my choir class when I was in middle school, and it was a lot of fun, so I like this film a lot.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Scrooge.jpeg" alt="Movie 6" />
      <h2>Scrooge: A Christmas Carol</h2>
      <p>The film is a reimagined animated musical of the classic story “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens. The movie was done really well through its animations, storytelling, and characters. I really enjoy how the film diving deep with empathy into Ebenezer Scrooge’s grief and past relationships to understand why he became bitter and how he was still caring.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Home Alone.jpeg" alt="Movie 7" />
      <h2>Home Alone</h2>
      <p>This is one of my favorite Christmas classics to watch, and I would watch it all the time growing up, especially during the Christmas season. I love the creativity and comedy of the movie, for it’s about a kid named Kevin who was accidentally left at home by himself without his family, who are in another state.  In the movie, Kevin would set up traps and outsmart the burglars trying to break into and steal from his home.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Monsters University.jpeg" alt="Movie 8" />
      <h2>Monsters University</h2>
      <p>I really loved this movie because I really enjoy learning how Mike and Sulley once hated each other and then formed an unlikely and unexpected friendship that lasted for years. The movie is about Mike going to college to become a scarer; however, he is having a hard time due to his appearance not being scary. This movie showed scenes of college life, fitting into society, and overcoming challenges despite all odds. </p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Meet the Robinsons.jpeg" alt="Movie 9" />
      <h2>Meet the Robinsons</h2>
      <p>I loved this movie for it always has been touching to me, for I loved the family dynamic in the film, and it really made me learn growing up that a family doesn’t have to be blood-related to become one. The film is about a boy named Lewis who just wanted to be adopted and loved by a family that he had dreamed of having, and then meeting a kid named Wilbur who takes him to the future. There, Lewis discovers what a family is and what it really means.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Frozen.jpeg" alt="Movie 10" />
      <h2>Frozen</h2>
      <p>This movie is about a princess named Elsa who has secret winter powers that she is afraid of, and her sister named Anna, who has a memory loss of the time Elsa accidentally hurt her due to her powers. However, on Elsa’s coronation day as queen, her powers were accidentally revealed, causing her to run away and creating the land to be covered in deep ice and snow as her emotions spin out of control. Therefore, Anna must find Elsa to stop this winter and rebuild her relationship with her sister. I loved how this movie is complex, and I really empathized with the characters, for it was really nice to see mental health taken seriously on screen.</p>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Beauty and the Beast.jpeg" alt="Movie 11" />
      <h2>Beauty and the Beast</h2>
      <p>This movie is about a girl named Bella who is beautiful but never fits in the society of her town, for she always has her head in a book. However, one day, she made a deal with the Beast that kept her father hostage to release him as she took his place instead, changing her life forever. My favorite and most relatable Disney princess to me was Bella from this movie. I really loved everything about this movie, from the animation, characters, and storyline.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie-card">
      <img src="images/Tangled Movie.jpeg" alt="Movie 12" />
      <h2>Tangled</h2>
      <p>A lost princess named Rapunzel was kidnapped and locked in a tower as a baby for years due to her hair keeping her kidnapper, or her mother, named Gothel, young due to its magic. One day, a thief trespassed into her tower, leading Rapunzel to blackmail him, taking her to see lanterns that happened every year on her birthday. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Rapunzel and Eugene, the thief, as they slowly started to fall in love. Mother Gothel was also a really good character. Her manipulation of gaslighting and narcissistic behavior really created her a realistic villain.</p>
