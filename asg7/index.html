            <h2 id="bio-heading">About Haruhi Fujioka</h2>
            <p>
              From the anime and manga of Ouran High School Host Club by Bisco Hatori, Haruhi Fujioka is the main protagonist who got a scholarship to the Ouran Academy, which is a school for the extremely wealthy upper class. However, after accidentally breaking an expensive vase and having to pay for it, Haruhi became a member of the Host Club disguised as a boy because of her uniform and short boy cut hair in order to pay her debt. Haruhi cares about people who are not in their class and is very intelligent, honest, and kind. Her sharp mind and empathy allow her to form deep relationships with other people around her and fix problems quickly. </p>
            <h3>Why Haruhi Fujioka would be the best President</h3>
            <p>
              Therefore, Haruhi Fujioka would be an amazing ruler, for she would be leading with fairness and kindness towards others, as she is very wise and compassionate. Haruhi treats everyone equally, not convinced about someone’s wealth or power, for she is friendly and open-minded, allowing her to gain trust from people when they discover she is genuine. Her awareness of people’s desires and emotions allows her to understand others better and leads her to be empathic and kind.  However, Haruhi is not just caring but also has a clever mind. Haruhi's intelligence and wisdom lead her to make choices that benefit and help or protect people, especially those in need. Therefore, I believe Haruhi Fujioka would make a wonderful president due to her genuine compassion and intelligent mind that can guide, support, and defend people in need.</p>

            As a result, Haruhi Fujioka and Kyoya Otori's campaign will be created on the cornerstone of fairness due to both of them understanding and supporting equality and protection for their people.

This can cause her to bring justice and encourage her people who are overlooked, for she can connect with them as she continues on her plan of reforming inequality policies. Kyoya's bright and strategic mind will enforce all plans and actions to become effective while making sure to governed properly, preventing corruption and maintaining sustainability. Therefore, by working together, Haruhi and Kyoya uphold a strong and honest governance, rightful change in the education system, and a stronger community, monitoring their people to help them participate in creating a better future and delivering hope.

          <p>Another character from Ouran High School Host Club is Kyoya Ootori, who would be the best running mate for Haruhi Fujioka. Kyoya is known for his leadership skills in the club, being the one who has uses deep research to make rational decisions and is able to take action effectively even in difficult challenges. He’s able to negotiate and take action on plans, despite the pressure to resolve problems while enhancing their club’s potential. He is also very loyal to those he is close to, such as Haruhi Fujioka, and over time becomes empathic and caring towards others people. Therefore, having him as vice president, Kyoya will guide every policy to ensure it is well-established and make sure plans are successful, while enhancing Haruhi’s leadership and actions. He would be the one helping others effectively while maintaining Haruhi’s loyalty, creating a team that was perfect for helping others.</p>
