	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>One of the topics I learned from reading my materials was about the current era of the Web, “Where we are now”. Such as the shift in social media or platforms for people who use Instagram or Twitter as their main source of content, and source of information. Or how fracturing is happening due to many people leaving major platforms to create something of their own, such as making personal blogs instead of meaning on a big platform. Another topic I learned is “read-write” web, or Web 2.0, which means a phase when websites are growing in terms of their users’ interaction. How websites are user-focused in usability, interoperability, and content, which leads them to become participative social web. During this time, blogs, social media, and video streaming gained fame, causing the rise of platforms like YouTube and Facebook to expand. The blogging platform became popular with WordPress, which turned into a fully advanced CMS. Therefore, I learned how Web 2.0 shifted people’s perspectives with online platforms and tools, bringing the concept of “Web as Platform” as software applications are being created on top of the Web, as opposed to the desktop. The final topic I had learned is about the “Web as a software platform” for developers has now gotten tools to build better and faster to create sustainable application like using framework such as React to build interactive UIs to become easier, package managers to allow developers to manage third-party libraries, and version control to allow team have wider ability and access to track changes and make collaborations. These three topics are just some of the examples of the things I learned from my readings.

<h2>Semester Project</h2>
<p> For my semester project, I was thinking about creating a recipe website that helps people make and learn about diabetes and prediabetes-friendly meals. The reason I wanted to make this website is that I know a lot of people who are struggling with diabetes or have impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, after talking to them, I discovered a lot of people don’t know what they should eat or make due to a lack of access to diabetic friendly recipes. I also learned they sometimes feel discouraged when they can’t go somewhere to find consistent recipes and information. Therefore, I wanted to make a website that is dedicated to making meals that are safe to eat and won’t trigger anyone’s blood sugar. Furthermore, for my website, I plan to have recipes, blogs, images (maybe videos), and ideas about how to make and learn about diabetic friendly meals for diabetics and prediabetics in need.
