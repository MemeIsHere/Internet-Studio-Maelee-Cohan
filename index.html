    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>To get to know me, some of my interests are enjoying content such as comedy, romance, and thriller films or books. My favorite Disney Princess is Belle from Beauty and the Beast, for she has been my favorite since my childhood, and I adore her character. I love cats very much; however, I’m currently allergic to many of them. Some of my hobbies I enjoy are cooking, baking, art, drawing, playing the piano, crafting, singing, dancing, and writing. Some new hobbies I’m trying to get more into are gaming and learning how to knit. Some of my current goals are learning how to film, animate, and edit, as I plan to make a YouTube channel in the near future. Other goals are graduating from college with great grades, participating in clubs or activities, and making new friends at university. </p>
