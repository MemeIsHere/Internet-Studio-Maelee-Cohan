      <h2>The Issues Why</h2>

    <p><span style="color:darkgreen;">My least favorite artist is Sabrina Carpenter. The first reason is her shift towards the male gaze and inappropriate behavior, which leads her to become a bad influence on young audiences. Sabrina came to face many people calling her out due to changing her lyrics to become dirty, intimating foreplay or sex positions on stage, making her concert outros have sexual lyrics, and wearing revealing clothes that look like lingerie. Therefore, this has resulted in her receiving a lot of attention and has led to her popularity. This isn’t anything new in the music industry, and many artists have performance serial content in their music and performances, such as Doja Cat and Cardi B. However, Sabrina isn’t viewed like that, for she is idolized like Taloy Swift due to her pop music, colorful appearance when she performs, and history as a child star on Disney. Therefore, this causes many young audiences, many being minors, to become her fans. This causes many issues for many adults and parents are upset that Sabrina music and performances aren’t “family-friendly” despite what her brand "interpret" and “appears to be, disguising her lyrics with upbeat melodies and glittery outfits. What worse is how Sabrina acts towards minors. During her concert she would make inappropriate jokes to kids such as “her clothes are coming off” just by looking at them, or giving sex handcuffs to kids who obviously appear to be children. Sabrina is fully aware of her actions and behavior; the way she interacts with minors is neither safe nor appropriate for children.  </span>

    <p><span style="color:darkgreen;">Another issue is that Sabrina is promoting abuse and hypocrisy in feminism. Sabrina's latest album cover, “Man’s Best Friend”, has faced much backlash. On the cover is a black and white image of Sarina on her hands and knees as a man pulls her hair. From her Instagram account, there was an image of a dog with the album title on its collar, indicating she is at the level of a dog. Many women face domestic, emotional, and sexual abuse from their partners. Therefore, creating a fantasy of this abuse isn’t right for women who have been hurt and died by their male partners every day; this isn’t something to mock or be viewed as a romance in any way. Sabrina claims to be a feminist, talking and singing songs about women's empowerment and rights. This is hypocrisy because Sabine can’t advocate for equal rights in gender if she is drawing attention to the male gaze and romanticizing abuse. If she were trying to support women, she shouldn’t sexualize herself, for many people will follow this ideology by taking it as truth, not as a joke. And if abuse is glamorized and accepted, it can become dangerous, as many women and men will accept it as normal, not a threat or issue, as it should be.  </span>
