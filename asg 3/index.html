  <p> <p>Framing my project in a story format helps me refine my ideas because I can alter my focus on the user’s journey instead of just the visual features. If my project is formed as storytelling, I will be able to draw out what my users will experience or the obstacles they will face from the start, the middle, and the end. To start, I will address the problems people with diabetes are struggling with in finding diabetes-friendly recipes. Then I would transition to the middle, where I would discover how my website would guide, engage, interact, and motivate my users with information and content that is helpful, important, and informative. Finally, I would learn and take notes if my users were able to successfully use my website and cook healthy, safe, and friendly meals. This narrative method helps me structure my purpose more clearly, making it clearer and easier for my users to use while making it engaging for them as well. Therefore, this narration would give me insights into my users' journey so I can learn what I need to work on and improve.

  <p>The different ways to emphasize hierarchy (emphasis) in typography design are using the size, color, weight, placement, and style, helping viewers follow a clear visual path. Larger text sizes draw the viewer’s attention to it first, such as headlines, for example, while smaller text is sub-dominant and used in paragraphs. If the color is more saturated, it will catch the viewer's eyes more, while a desaturated color will bring the text to the back. Color is also used to highlight certain crucial parts to guide the viewers to know where to locate significant words or information. Lighter weights are more subtle than heavier weights as they draw more attention. Placement of the texts is crucial for the location of the words, which can affect the layout on the grid while revealing where important information should go or be noticed first. Finally, spacing is significant for leading, white space around pieces of text, and letter-spacing can determine the shape of the design.

  <h2>Creative Brief Part 3</h2>
  <p>Problem</p>

<p>Many people who are pre-diabetic or diabetic don’t have a lot of trustworthy, easy, and safe-to-use recipes. Even though websites like Diabetes Food Hub, Good Food, Mayo Clinic, and Delish provided many diabetic-friendly recipes, users could feel uncertain and overwhelmed if the recipes actually support their health and are enjoyable to eat.</p> 

<p>Audience</p>
<p>
My audience will be anybody who is managing their blood sugar, caretakers, or people who are looking for healthier recipes to follow. Therefore, my recipes have to be easy to follow, engaging, and safe for my audience. That my audience should feel safe and trustworthy on my website while making sure my recipes are clear and interesting to follow. </p>

<p>Key Messages </p>

<p>Diabetes-friendly doesn’t have to be bland or harmful. </p>
<p>There are a lot of recipes that are not safe for their blood sugar or aren’t very flavorful or tasty. It seems like a sacrifice must be made when making food between health and taste; however, it doesn’t have to be. By using the Better User Experience Through Storytelling article, I can create my framing contest to be told as a narrative. Instead of just pouring in a bunch of recipes as a list, I could create a narrative explaining how a meal creates healthier lifestyles. Or share short stories of people's success and discover that they could manage their health with flavorful meals. These narratives would help make my website more emotional and relatable to my audience, not just informative.  </p>

<p>Simple and smart design can make learning easier. </p>
<p>Learning how a website works shouldn't be difficult; instead, it should be engaging and easy for my audience. The Do’s and Don’ts of Web Design article emphasizes how elements that are clickable must be obvious to the user and not difficult to find. Therefore, if the narration on my website and the buttons that are supposed to be clicked on are hard to identify or hidden, my users would get annoyed or frustrated and possibly leave the site. When designing my website, I need to have a well-labeled menu, buttons that are easy to identify, and links that would motivate my audience to explore to create a user experience that is stress-free, easier, and more enjoyable. 
</p>
<p> Eating healthy should be encouraged.  </p>
<p>People with diabetes or prediabetes shouldn’t feel or see eating as punishment. Many people think healthy recipes are restrictive and boring, not understanding how it’s actually the opposite. Therefore, my website should highlight how meals can be healthy, easy, and tasty while motivating my audience to explore and try out recipes on my website. A way to do this is to use the right typography to enhance my website design to make it more friendly and easier to use.  In Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography, the document describes how typography can strengthen encouragement. By using typography designed in a proper formation or style, I can create my text to be located clearly for my audience. How I  would create my recipe names to stand out, instructions should be legible even on smaller screens on people’s devices, and there is enough space on my website to make the audience not feel cramped while scrolling or exploring on my page. Eating healthy can be convincing for my audience when they are able to find healthy and tasty recipes more easily, causing them to be more motivated to explore and use my site. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Call to Action</p>
<p>“Cooking Made Easy” would be a quote I would use to encourage my audience to try new recipes, explore my site, and become a member on the site so they could share their stories about eating healthy.  </p>

<p>How to Measure Success</p>
<ul>
      <li> If my website is being socially active, such as recipes being shared or my blog has comments.
  
        <li> If the users are giving back positive feedback on the taste and ability of my recipes. 
   
          <li> The time spent on my site by my users.

    <li> If the number of recipe page visits on my site is increasing among my users.
