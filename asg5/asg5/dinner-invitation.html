      <h2>📚 Belle – Beauty and the Beast</h2>
      <p>The first person I invite as my guest of honor would be Belle from Beauty and the Beast. Belle lived in a small town, who dreamed of something more in her life before she went to the Beast’s castle to save her father and make a deal with the Beast, whom she later fell in love with. Growing up, Belle was my favorite Disney Princess, for she was very representative and relatable to me. I always enjoyed the movie because it was magical and wonderful to me. Belle also really enjoys reading a lot and has an intelligent mind that is always curious to explore and learn. Therefore, we would get along really well, as we both enjoy being bookworms and would have endless conversations about the books we enjoy or wish to read. Belle is a very sweet and beautiful character at heart, so I believe having a conversation with her won’t be difficult at all. </p>

      <h2>👑 Catherine Howard – Queen of England</h2>
      <p>The second person I would invite to my dinner would be Catherine Howard, who was Henry VIII’s sixth wife. I’m really into history and enjoy learning about historical figures. I also enjoy listening to and watching musicals. Therefore, when I discovered SIX the Musical, I started to do more research about the Tudor Era, Henry VIII, and, of course, all six of his wives. So, when I discovered Catherine Howard's background, I felt saddened by the life she had been through, and her exhaustion when she was only just a teenager. She didn’t get a safe childhood growing up because she didn’t receive proper guidance and was constantly abused and mistreated, especially by men. If I had the chance, I would want to invite her to dinner to give her a place to relax and feel safe, even if it’s only for a moment. I will tell her that what she did isn’t her fault, even if she didn’t make the right decisions; she wasn’t to blame.  The adults in her life were supposed to help and protect her, not take advantage of her and lead her to death. I can’t save everybody in history, for there are many people like her who have been hurt and abandoned, especially at a young age. But at least I can help one person receive comfort, even if it’s for a short time over dinner. </p>

      <h2>⭐ Usagi Tsukino – Sailor Moon</h2>
      <p>Finally, the last person I would be my guest is Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon. To explain a bit about her backstory, Usagi is a teenage girl whose secret identity is Sailor Moon. We fight with her friends, also her team, against evil. I would go to dinner because she has a bubbly, hyper, and funny personality. She’s somebody that people can get comfortable with due to how friendly and kind-hearted she is. She also really likes to eat and enjoys eating delicious food a lot, so I’m more than happy to invite her to dinner to try my cooking. One of my acts of love is feeding people, so seeing someone enjoy my food and eat well makes me happy. I also like to give everyone leftovers to take home after dinner, so I think she’ll enjoy those as well.</p>
