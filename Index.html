To begin, the difference between structured content and semantic HTML is that structured content is formed by modular chunks, while semantic HTML explains the hierarchy and relationships of the chunks. As explained by the article, structured content is not a finished page, but instead a collection of important and meaningful data - such as title, recipe instructions, product descriptions, etc. - that breaks everything down for each chunk to have a purpose and relationship with other pieces, which creates the overall content clear and crucial. Next, Semantic HTML is the markup that conveys these relationships, for it doesn't just control and maintain how the connection should look on screen but also expresses its purpose and structure. For example, using < h1 > and < h2 > tags shows hierarchy and conveys the significance of the headings. Or by using < li > within < ol > tags, arranges the list of items in a format that can be realized both by machines and humans to be overstepped and interpreted. Therefore, structured content and semantic HTML work together to create unity. Structured breaks down the data in modular, purposeful units that can be used again across contexts. Then, semantic HTML will communicate the reliability of the chunks to enforce and ensure that they can be usable and understandable to both the machines and viewers. Therefore, when structured content creates reusable and meaningful information, and semantic HTML rearranges their meanings or purpose by making it available to search engines and technological assistance, they create units for both of them to play a major role in form enhancement. Furthermore, it’s important to have structured content and semantic HTML in my web pages to make my website more accessible and advanced. To explain, having structured content with semantic markup would enable search engines to generate rich snippets, such as recipes that would display ingredients or cooking times on the screen while making my search results clear for users. Another example would be having a structured and semantically marked content to enforce my website work across platforms such as apps, desktops, and voice assistance. These things would not only improve the usability for my users but also make my website faster and clearer, causing them to be more adaptable.</p>

 <h3>Part 4</h3>
 <p>To me I think the most successful method of Denise Jacobs for myself would be “Turning Antagonism Into Partnership".  Jacobs suggested changing my perspective because instead of seeing soccer critics as a rival, I could be seeing them as an assistant by giving them a different and new role. Therefore, this allows me to receive help during the correction and editing stage, but not stop creative thinking and flow. This method would definitely fit me the most because I sometimes get stuck due to wanting everything perfect the first time, causing me a lot of stress. So, if I treat my inner critic as an assistant instead of a judge, I would be less worried and frustrated, causing me to be more productive as I can focus and create new ideas for work, allowing me to be a princess and move onward. Next, in David McRaney's article, hyperbolic discounting means people are more likely to go for smaller and instant rewards instead of bigger and delayed ones. One of the methods of McRaney that counteract hyperbolic discounting is pre-commitment, which is locking yourself into an action for the future to avoid giving in to fast temptations, like scheduling tasks. Therefore, for me, the best method that would work for me is removing temptations to decrease the access to discrete activities that involve long-term goals, making it easier for me to focus on the task at hand right now, and will benefit me in the future. Finally, from the Crucial Web Design textbook, the network-making power I have as a creator of my work would be the user interaction, for I have chosen how my users would navigate on my site, as well as what people would click and interact with. Therefore, I would have the power to shape and control the flow or presentation of information on my site, creating structure in network-making power, determining how the network should function by designing the web’s navigation and interactions. </p>
