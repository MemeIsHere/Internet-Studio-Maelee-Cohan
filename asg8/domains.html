    <h2>Classmate's Discussion </h2>

 <section class="classmate">
    <p>I reviewed my domain names with my classmate during this week, and we were coming up with different ideas of what names to use for my website. We only talked about my website because they already did theirs with someone else, so we have a penalty of time to talk. We went over my goal for my final project. I explained how I wanted to create a website that is focused on making recipes that are diabetic-friendly while having a blog on helpful information or tips, like how to manage your blood sugar or kitchen hacks. First we went over the Comprehensive Domain Extensions List. Therefore, we started deciding and reassuring if I should put .com or .recipes for my website. Because I was going to include recipes and a blog on my website, we agreed to do .com instead. </p>

     <p>Next, we went over the Domain Naming Slides to help come up with names for my website. For the first name, we came up with DiaDelish.com (diadelish.com) for the name, which is an affixed word that is a combination of "diabetic" and "delicious" put together. We both liked this name, for it was short and was catchy to say out loud. The next name was SmartSugarKitchen.com (smartsugarkitchen.com). This phrase name was made out of real words put together with clear meanings. We discussed how "smart," meaning finding new effective ways or ideas of something, "sugar" represented diabetes and maintaining blood sugar, and "kitchen" indicated how the website focuses on recipes and food. The name wasn’t too long because we originally came up with ideas like “SugarSmartsBeingInTheKitchen.com” or “SugarSmartsInTheKitchen.” However, all of those names are too long for my website. Finally, the last name we picked was LowGluBites.com (lowglubites.com). “Low” and “glu” added together represent the word “low glucose,” making this part of the name an affixed word. Then “bite” is added at the end of the name to represent eating and taking a bite of food, representing how recipes and meals will be on my website. After double-checking the names on domain websites for availability with my classmate, we were able to set these three names, for we both liked these names the best.</p>
